<h4>Professional Background</h4>
    <p>I have over ten years of experience in the electronic payments industry, working in highly regulated and mission-critical environments where reliability, precision, and operational discipline are essential. This background has shaped my mindset around responsibility, teamwork, and delivering high-quality results under pressure.</p>
    
    <h4>Cloud & DevOps Journey</h4>
    <p>I’m currently specializing in Cloud and DevOps Engineering, focusing on automation, infrastructure as code, and cloud-native architectures. I work daily with Linux, Docker, Terraform, AWS services, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD practices. I enjoy understanding how systems behave, building reproducible infrastructure, and improving the reliability of modern cloud applications.</p>
    
    <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
    <p>My hands-on experience includes AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFormation, IAM, Route 53), Linux administration, containerization with Docker, infrastructure as code with Terraform, and continuous integration/deployment pipelines. I’m also comfortable with networking fundamentals and scripting for automation.</p>
    
    <h4>Values, People & Culture</h4>
    <p>Beyond the technical aspect, I strongly believe that great engineering teams are defined by their culture. I founded the Diversity & Inclusion Committee at Solaris and later took an active role in the Inclusion Committee at Deutsche Bank. These experiences reinforced my belief that trust, inclusion, and shared values are essential for teams to thrive — and I enjoy contributing to both the technical and human sides of an organization.</p>
    
    <h4>What I’m Looking For</h4>
    <p>I’m seeking an opportunity to grow as a DevOps/Cloud Engineer, contribute to real-world cloud projects, and bring together my technical skills, my background in critical environments, and my commitment to building strong, inclusive teams.</p>
